 <img src="cv.jpg" alt="my profile pic"width="200px" height="200px">
 Before moving to Sweden, I studied Law in Ethiopia and was working as a legal advisor for the Addis Ababa city administration. The limitation for me now is that my expertise in law cannot easily be transferred to the Swedish job market since the law I practiced is specific to Ethiopia. As a result, I am exploring a career option that is practical; that I have interest in and that contributes to the community I live and in the long run can be expanded to serve the community I come from. Learning coding and web page design can open a door of opportunities for me to explore the Swedish job market.
